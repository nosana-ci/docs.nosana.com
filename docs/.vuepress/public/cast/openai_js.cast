[8.397864, "o", "Okay, so I need to write a haiku about recursion in programming. A haiku is a traditional Japanese poem with a 5-7-5 syllable structure. I remember they're pretty simple and fit neatly into classical Japanese writing. Hmm, how to tie recursion into that.\r\n\r\nFirst, I know recursion in programming is when a function calls itself, usually solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller parts. So maybe I can focus on breaking down a problem or creating patterns that themselves reference themselves. That strikes a good balance with recursion.\r\n\r\nFor the first line, I want it to describe the recursion itself or its role. Maybe something like breaking down a problem or using recursion to solve it. Let's think... \"Broken down by recursion\" – that sounds good.\r\n\r\nThe second line should build on that. Perhaps describe the process or action. How about \"calls itself, each time solving a smaller problem\"? That captures the function calling itself and handling the smaller tasks.\r\n\r\nNow the third line is tricky. Need to tie into the structure of a haiku, which has an abcd in the first line. Maybe \"the same pattern repeats again, each time solving a smaller problem.\" That maintains the recursive theme and keeps the syllable count in check.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together: \r\n\"I break down a problem by recursion, \r\nEach time calling itself, solving a smaller problem.\" \r\nFor the third line, I need to complete it and integrate the structure. Maybe:\r\n\"the same pattern repeats again, \r\neach time solving a smaller problem.\" That's five syllables, matching the structure.\r\n\r\nWait, let me count the syllables. First line: \"Broken down by recursion\" is 6. That's too long for a haiku, which has 5. Oops, I need to adjust.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, \"Dividing a problem into divisions by recursion\" – five syllables. Then \"As each division calls itself, solving a smaller problem.\" That lines up with the 5-7-5 structure. Yes, that seems better.\r\n\r\nI think this works because it clearly shows the recursion through each division, with the function calling itself each time, facing smaller tasks. It follows the syllable requirement.\r\n</think>\r\n\r\nIn the land where numbers divide,  \r\neach part calls itself to solve.  \r\nDivisions-seeking a path clear,  \r\neach call facing the next thread.\r\n"]
