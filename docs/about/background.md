# Background

In 2021, our ambitious team, Nosana, based in Amsterdam, embarked on an extraordinary journey to revolutionize computing. Our goal was to build a decentralized crowd computer tailored for CPU computations, with a specific focus on transforming the field of CI/CD. We believed this technology could enable faster and more efficient software development and deployment processes.

With diverse backgrounds in software engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence, we pooled our expertise to develop the platform. Through extensive research into distributed systems, blockchain technology, and computer hardware, we created a cutting-edge solution from scratch, leveraging each team member's unique insights and skills.

We successfully received a grant from the Solana Foundation, launched a token, and raised pre-seed funding for our vision. Throughout the development process, we encountered technical challenges and scalability issues. However, our unwavering determination and collective expertise propelled us forward. We continuously refined the system, prioritizing security, efficiency, and user-friendliness.

We have multiple large-scale crypto projects on the CI/CD engine, running numerous workloads on a daily basis. However, as we progressed, we realized that the CI/CD industry alone might not provide the scale we sought. We needed to pivot and explore broader applications for our decentralized crowd computer.

Then we ran our GPU pilot with AI inference workloads. Our hard work began to pay off. We successfully started to pivot, harnessing the collective GPU power of users worldwide, hand in hand with the growing demand for AI workloads.

Today, we stand at the forefront of a new era in GPU computing. Our decentralized crowd computer has exceeded our initial expectations, especially with the AI revolution in full swing and the growing demand for GPU devices distributed all over the globe in the houses of gamers, miners, and MacBook owners. And this is just the beginning. Stay up-to-date with our progress and news by reading our [blog](https://nosana.com/blog).
