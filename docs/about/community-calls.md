# Community Calls
Monthly community calls with Team Nosana take place on the last Thursday of each month, unless stated otherwise on our Discord or Socials. The current joining link will be posted in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nosana-ai) server as well as our social media account on X. During each call we'll be discussing the latest updates, and your feedback and ideas will help shape the future of our project.

List of 2025 calls and onwards can be found on [our YouTube channel](url) by clicking the image below:
