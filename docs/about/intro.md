# Introduction

Welcome to the Nosana Network! Let us give you an introduction to Nosana and her vision

## What is Nosana?

**About Nosana**

Nosana is a GPU marketplace built to make AI compute accessible and affordable for businesses and developers. Focused on AI inference, Nosana connects Hosts—data centers and hardware owners—with Clients who need scalable and cost-effective GPU compute for AI Inference workloads. Nosana is addressing the shortage of GPUs in the market, making it easier for companies to get access to the necessary hardware. They are also taking advantage of underutilized hardware, such as gaming PCs, miners, and MacBooks, and offering competitive prices for building and running AI-solutions.

Nosana provides a distributed GPU grid that allows anyone to rent compute power without the usual overhead, excessive fees of lock-in. By turning idle GPUs into valuable resources, Nosana Network helps reduce e-waste and lower operational costs while driving innovation. Learn more at [Nosana.com](https://nosana.com)

## What Nosana Offers

Nosana is a platform that provides AI users with affordable GPUs and GPU owners with an income. GPU owners can rent their GPUs to AI users, who in turn can access powerful hardware and train and use their models faster. Nosana also provides users with a powerful suite of tools to help them get the most out of their GPU resources. With easy-to-use APIs and flexible pricing options, Nosana makes it easier than ever to access the power of AI.

## Ultimate Vision

We aim to bring the disruptive power of blockchain technology to the field of AI. As we move toward a future that is more decentralized, our **ultimate vision** is that projects will not rely on centralized mega-corporations for their daily operations. We believe that communities can perform essential computations in a decentralized manner by utilizing the Nosana Network. With Nosana, a robust community has the ability to keep any project running forever.


## Founders

Nosana was founded by [Jesse Eisses](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-eisses-9760ab48) and [Sjoerd Dijkstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjoerd-dijkstra/), driven by the goal of making GPU compute accessible to everyone. They believe GPUs should be a shared resource, helping businesses and individuals harness the power of AI without high costs or barriers.
