# Terminology

### Account

The blockchain wallet address you use to interact with the Nosana Network.

### Burner Phone NFT

The [NFTs](https://nft.nosana.io/) of the Nosana Network.
Burner Phones grant access to operate a node on the network, access to special community channels, network boosts,
and more.

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery is a software development practice that uses automation to speed the release of new code.
It establishes a process through which a developer’s changes to an application can be pushed to a code repository
or container registry through automation.

### Continuous Integration

With continuous integration, new code changes to an app are produced, tested, and merged into a shared repository on a
regular basis. It is a solution to the problem of having too many app branches in development at the same time
that may clash with each other.

### Container Image

An unchangeable, static file that includes executable code so it can run an isolated process on information technology
(IT) infrastructure.

### Claim Rewards

When new fees are added to the staking program, they are distributed to all current stakers.
Claiming rewards adds these tokens to your account.
You can upstake or extend and tese rewards will add to the tokens you already have staked.
If you are looking to unstake, you will need to claim any rewards first before you unstake,
or those rewards will be lost to you and transfered back into the program for distribution to other stakers.

### Claim Transfer

The `claimTransfer()` instruction claims emissions from a Nosana Pool with claim type `0`,
and transfer these to a given `user`.

### Dashboard

The UI of the Nosana Network where users can update their account, run pipelines, run a node, stake NOS tokens,
claim network rewards, and see statistics of the Nosana Network.

### Docker

Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage
containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS)
libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

### Extend Stake

This [extend instruction](/programs/staking#extend) allows stakers to extend the
duration of a stake.

### Jobs

Projects can post pipeline jobs through the Nosana Jobs program.
It lets nodes in the Nosana Network earn tokens by doing those jobs.

### Leaderboard

The leaderboard is a feature in the Nosana Dashboard that shows a list of wallets who have staked NOS tokens and
displays that wallet address' xNOS score.

### NFT

Stands for Non-Fungible Token. It’s a unique, one-of-a-kind crypto asset (which can be anything from art to music)
that’s stored on a blockchain. NFTs can be for pure speculation, or they can provide utility for things such as access,
discounts, etc.

### Node

A machine which is part of the Nosana Network and capable of executing pipelines or jobs.

### Pipeline

An automated representation of your software delivery process, from version control to your users and clients.
This process entails developing software in a reliable and repeatable manner, as well as advancing the developed
software ("builds") through many stages of testing and deployment.

### Pools

The [Nosana Pools Program](/programs/pools) allows for users to open token pools with
predefined emission rates.

### Rewards

The [Nosana Rewards Program](/programs/rewards) allow stakers to earn rewards.
Anyone that has staked NOS tokens can enter the rewards program.

### Solana

Solana is a blockchain platform designed to host decentralized applications. Based on proof of history,
it processes transactions quickly at low cost.

### Stake

To lock your crypto asset for a set period of time to help support the operation of a blockchain or project.
In return for staking your crypto, you generally earn more cryptocurrency.

### Unstake

The action that removes tokens from a locked state. Staking programs vary in their unstake lock periods.

### NOS

[NOS](/tokens/token) is the native token of the Nosana Network.

### xNOS

xNOS is used to determine your position on the leaderboard, which determines the number of raffle tickets you receive
for our seasonal NFT drops. It's also used to give out NOS rewards. Your xNOS score will be compared to the total
xNOS built up in our network in the rewards section of our dashboard. This determines how many tokens you will
receive from the Staking Protocol's daily NOS token rewards.
