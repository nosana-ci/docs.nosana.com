# Introduction

> For every developer that values transparency and trust.

This is Nosana CI.

Nosana introduces a [decentralized CI/CD](/platform/cicd) solution on the Solana
blockchain. Nosana leverages the Proof-of-History consensus of the Solana Network
to build out a truly decentralized continuous integration, delivery, and deployment
platform for open source repositories.

The platform combines edge-computing and blockchain functionality into 1 solution.
The [`NOS`](/project/tokenomics) token fuels the system by creating an open
[marketplace](/platform/market). People and machine can use and
share compute power to execute their software delivery pipelines.
