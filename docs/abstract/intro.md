# Welcome to Nosana

> For every software developer that values transparency and trust.

This is Nosana CI. The only decentralized CI/CD platform, powered by the Solana Network, 
and fueled by the <strong>NOS</strong> token.

Nosana leverages the Proof-of-History consensus of the Solana Network
to build out a truly software pipelines.

::: tip Nosana CI
Run code checks and build container images to earn tokens. 
Or simply use other Nosana nodes to run your pipelines on demand!
:::

The platform combines edge-computing and blockchain functionality into 1 solution.
The [`NOS`](../tokenomics/metrics) token fuels the system by creating an open
[marketplace](../tokenomics/utility). People and machine can use and
share compute power to execute their software delivery pipelines.

Nosana pipelines, and phases of developement, consist of 3 individual components:

- [Continuous Integration](../nosana/integration), 
   The "Nosana Test Suite" to test assert the codeâ€™s correctness before integration.
- [Continuous Delivery](../nosana/delivery), 
   The "Nosana Release Suite" to build, test and scan your software   
- [Continuous Deployment](../nosana/deployment), 
   The "Nosana Deployer" helps deploying releases to environments in a secure and automated manner.   

All built completely on the Solana Network.

Welcome to Nosana, the platform that consists of everything you need to accelerate your development!
