# Introduction

This is Nosana CI.

> For every software developer that values transparency and trust.
 
Nosana is a decentralized CI/CD platform on the Solana Network, 
and fueled by the <strong>NOS</strong> token.

Nosana leverages the Proof-of-History consensus of the Solana Network
to build out a truly decentralized continuous integration, delivery, and deployment
platform for open source repositories.

::: tip Nosana CI
Run code checks and build container images to earn tokens. 
Or simply use other Nosana nodes to run your pipelines on demand!
:::


The platform combines edge-computing and blockchain functionality into 1 solution.
The [`NOS`](/project/tokenomics) token fuels the system by creating an open
[marketplace](/platform/market). People and machine can use and
share compute power to execute their software delivery pipelines.
