# Setup for Ubuntu

Greetings! This is your comprehensive guide to setting up the GPU Host on an Ubuntu system. Whether you are a seasoned developer or new to the Linux world, this easy-to-follow tutorial will assist you in getting your GPU Host operational on your Ubuntu setup. Let's dive in and start the process.

1. [Install Docker](#docker)
2. [Install NVIDIA drivers and container toolkit](#nvidia)
3. [Run the GPU Host and register for Nosana Grid](#nosana-join-grid-script)

Make sure you have Ubuntu version **20.04** or higher. You can check your Ubuntu version with:

```sh:no-line-numbers
lsb_release -a
```

## Docker

Before proceeding with the installation and configuration of Docker, it is important to ensure that the appropriate privileges have been assigned. To do so, please refer to the following links for detailed instructions on properly installing and configuring Docker:

- [Install Docker Engine](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-22-04)
- [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)

By following these steps, you will be able to run the GPU Host without the need for root privileges.

## NVIDIA

To fully utilize the GPU on the grid, we will need to install both the NVIDIA drivers and NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit.

## NVIDIA Driver Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install the NVIDIA drivers on your system:

1. Visit the official NVIDIA website or the link provided (https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-nvidia-driver-ubuntu) to download the correct driver.
2. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions provided.
3. After installation, check that the correct driver is installed by using the command `nvidia-smi` in the terminal.
4. If the command displays the correct driver information, the installation was successful. If not, try reinstalling the driver or seeking further assistance.

Example output:

### Guide to Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit

To install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) (`nvidia-ctk`), run the following commands:
```sh:no-line-numbers
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list \
  && \
    sudo apt-get update
```
Then we can install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit package:
```sh:no-line-numbers
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
```

#### Configuring the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on Linux

As we aim to run Podman within Docker, adhere to the Docker configuration instructions detailed here: [Configuring Docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#configuring-docker).

Execute the following commands in your terminal:

```sh:no-line-numbers
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
```

Subsequently, restart Docker with:

```sh:no-line-numbers
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Join the Grid

With just a single command in your command line, you can easily set up a GPU Host on your machine. Simply run the following command:

```sh:no-line-numbers
bash <(wget -qO- https://nosana.com/start.sh)
```

Please note that this script has certain requirements and is specifically designed to run without the need for sudo privileges. It's crucial to exercise caution when running any script from the internet with sudo privileges. Even in this case, it's advisable to thoroughly review the script before executing it on your system. You can review the script here: [https://nosana.com/start.sh](https://nosana.com/start.sh)

The script performs a series of tests to verify the successful completion of the previous steps outlined in the guide.

You will see your node's information displayed in the following format.

```
  _   _
 | \ | | ___  ___  __ _ _ __   __ _
 |  \| |/ _ \/ __|/ _` | '_ \ / _` |
 | |\  | (_) \__ \ (_| | | | | (_| |
 |_| \_|\___/|___/\__,_|_| |_|\__,_|

Reading keypair from ~/.nosana/nosana_key.json

Network:	    mainnet
Wallet:		    <NODE_ADDRESS>
SOL balance:	0E-9 SOL
NOS balance:	0 NOS
Provider:	    podman
```


### Nosana Grid Registration Instructions

When running the script it'll ask for some information: email, Discord & Twitter/X handle (optional). After filling in the information and agreeing to the terms & conditions, a benchmark will start. In this benchmark we will check the hardware of your node.

::: warning

To find your Node's Solana key, navigate to `~/.nosana/nosana_key.json`. It is **essential** to back up this file to ensure its safety.

## Optional: Run Podman in Docker

If you're running Ubuntu natively, you can use Docker to initiate your Podman instance. The `start.sh` script accomplishes this in the final step, making this a non-mandatory step:

```sh:no-line-numbers
    docker volume create podman-socket
    docker run -d \
        --pull=always \
        --gpus=all \
        --name podman \
        --device /dev/fuse \
        --mount source=podman-cache,target=/var/lib/containers \
        --volume podman-socket:/podman \
        --privileged \
        -e ENABLE_GPU=true \
        nosana/podman:v1.1.0 unix:/podman/podman.sock
```

To confirm GPU support within Podman containers, execute:

```
docker exec -it podman bash
podman run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all --security-opt=label=disable ubuntu nvidia-smi -L
```

If unsuccessful, ensure NVIDIA drivers and the nvidia-ctk are [installed](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) and [configured](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#configuring-docker)

If you see `Error: container create failed (no logs from conmon)...` when running the command, follow the steps [here](/nodes/troubleshoot.html#podman) to resolve issue

## Launching the GPU Host with Custom Parameters

You can manually launch the GPU Host to modify certain parameters:
* Use the `--podman` parameter to direct to your Podman socket if it's located elsewhere.
* Use `--volume` to map your solana key to `/root/.nosana/nosana_key.json` within the Docker container if you wish to use your own key.

```sh:no-line-numbers
docker run \
      --pull=always \
      --network host  \
      --interactive -t \
      --volume ~/.config/solana/id.json:/root/.nosana/nosana_key.json \
      --volume podman-socket:/root/.nosana/podman:ro \
      nosana/nosana-cli:latest node start \
         --podman /root/.nosana/podman/podman.sock
```
