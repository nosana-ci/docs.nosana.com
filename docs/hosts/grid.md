# Getting Started

## Welcome to the Nosana GPU Marketplace

The Nosana Network connects GPU Hosts with Clients who need scalable, cost-effective GPU compute. As a GPU Host, youâ€™ll contribute to a decentralized ecosystem by listing your NVIDIA GPUs on the Nosana Marketplace for AI inference and other compute workloads.

## GPU Hosts

GPU Hosts run the Nosana Node software, which connects your hardware to the marketplace. To register your device, it must include a compatible NVIDIA GPU.

::: warning
We recommend running the Nosana Node software in a virtual environment and using a Solana wallet with only a minimal amount of SOL.

::: info
For clarity we would also like to inform you that Nosana supports
**1 private key per GPU, 1 GPU per PC**

## Hardware Requirements

To participate as a GPU Host, ensure your setup meets the following criteria:

- **RAM**: 12GB+
- **Storage**: 256GB+ NVMe (SSD)

  Large language models storage requirements can be high, especially models geared towards higher end GPUâ€™s. It is recommended that ancillary storage up to 1TB be provided for your host to handle client model requirements.

- **Bandwidth**: Minimum 100 Mb/s download, 50 Mb/s upload.

  High speed internet speed is required. To increase your chances of your host being hired by a client, we recommend 500 Mb/s download, 250 Mb/s upload, with ping below 100ms.

- **Supported NVIDIA GPUs**:

<!-- ## Software Requirements
You will need to install the following to get started as a GPU Host:

- [Ubuntu (>20.04) or Windows (with Ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2)](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#3-download-ubuntu)
- [Docker (Required)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/)
  - [Podman (Optional - Required for WSL2)](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=devel%3Akubic%3Alibcontainers%3Aunstable&package=podman)
- [NVIDIA Drivers (Required)](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-nvidia-driver-ubuntu)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Required)](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
- [Solana Tool Suite (Optional)](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) -->

## Installation Guides

Follow these guides to become a GPU Host or list your hardware on the Nosana Network:

1. [Windows (WSL2)](/hosts/grid-windows): Learn how to list your hardware using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, allowing Linux to run on your Windows machine.

2. [Ubuntu](/hosts/grid-ubuntu): Follow this guide if you're using Ubuntu, a widely used Linux distribution.

## Host Your GPU

After listing your hardware on the Nosana Network, youâ€™re ready to start hosting! Launch your GPU Host to begin contributing compute power and earning rewards.
