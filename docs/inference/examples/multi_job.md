# Multi Operation Job

The Nosana job specification allows you to define multiple chunks of operations to be defined in one job.
Each chunk of operations can happen in it's own predetermined container, making for any number of customization that your needs require.
Example: You could start off your Nosana job in an Alpine container, and then hand off the results to a container that has an LLM, then over to an Ubuntu container for post processing.

## JSON Job Schema

Here below we can see how with the `ops` array, we can define multiple JSON objects each containing it's own job.
Each job has a `type`, `id`, and an `args` object containing:
- `cmd`: An array of shell commands that need to be executed
- `image`: The container image used to run the shell commands
- `volumes`: Docker volumes that need to be attached to this operation
- `work_dir`: The working directory within which the shell commands will run.

::: info
Create a file named `multi_job.json`, copy and paste the following into it:
:::

```json
{
  "version": "0.1",
  "type": "container",
  "meta": {
    "trigger": "cli"
  },
  "global": {
    "work_dir": "/home/",
    "env": {
      "DEBUG": "1"
    }
  },
  "ops": [
    {
      "type": "container/create-volume",
      "id": "create-volume",
      "args": {
        "name": "random-id-volume"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "container/run",
      "id": "run-from-cli",
      "args": {
        "cmd": [
          "/bin/bash -c ",
          "echo Hello World > /nosana/outputs/test.txt;",
          "ls /nosana/outputs;",
          "pwd;"
        ],
        "image": "ubuntu",
        "volumes": [
          {
            "name": "random-id-volume",
            "dest": "/nosana/outputs"
          }
        ],
        "work_dir": "/home/podman"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "container/run",
      "id": "run-from-cli-2",
      "args": {
        "cmd": "/bin/bash -c 'echo Hello World; ls; pwd;'",
        "image": "ubuntu"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Command

Run the following command to post the job to the network.

```sh:no-line-numbers
nosana job post --file multi_job.json --market 97G9NnvBDQ2WpKu6fasoMsAKmfj63C9rhysJnkeWodAf
```

## Output

When the Nosana job is posted successfully you should see something similar to the following:

```sh:no-line-numbers
