# Getting Started

## Nosana GPU Grid

Welcome to the Nosana GPU Grid, a platform designed to validate our GPU grid across a diverse array of GPU devices.

## Nosana Node

The Nosana Node is the software that you run to connect your hardware to the grid.
In order to register for the Nosana Grid, you'll need to run a Nosana Node with a NVIDIA GPU.

::: warning

At the moment the Nosana Node is in pre-release. Therefore we highly recommend to run this in a clean environment or virtual machine, and to use a Solana address with only a minimal amount of SOL.

<!-- ## Software Requirements
You will need to install the following to get started with a Nosana Node:

- [Ubuntu (>20.04) or Windows (with Ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2)](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#3-download-ubuntu)
- [Docker (Required)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/)
  - [Podman (Optional - Required for WSL2)](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=devel%3Akubic%3Alibcontainers%3Aunstable&package=podman)
- [NVIDIA Drivers (Required)](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-nvidia-driver-ubuntu)
- [NVIDIA Container Toolkit (Required)](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
- [Solana Tool Suite (Optional)](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) -->

## Installation Guides

These guides are instructing you on how to establish your Nosana Node and partake in the Nosana Grid. The choice of guide depends on your operating system:

1. [Windows (WSL2)](/nodes/grid-windows): This guide is suitable for you if you're running Windows. WSL2 stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, which allows you to run Linux on your Windows machine. Following this guide, you'll be able to set up your Nosana Node within this environment.

2. [Ubuntu](/nodes/grid-ubuntu): If you're running Ubuntu, a popular distribution of Linux, you should follow this guide.

## Run your Node

After you have successfully installed the Nosana Node and registered for the Nosana Grid, you can now start up your node and join the Nosana Grid!
