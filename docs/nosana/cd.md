# Nosana Delivery and Deployment Suite

Nosana's  third, and final, product will be the Deployment Suite.
Using this suite, developers will be able to release their software quicker, safer and easier.

## What is Continuous Delivery?

Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, 
ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time and, when releasing the software, 
without doing so manually.
It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency.
The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental 
updates to applications in production.

A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery.

CD contrasts with continuous deployment, a similar approach in which software is also produced in short cycles 
but through automated deployments rather than manual ones.

Nosana's other third, and final, product will be the Deployment Suite.
Using this suite, developers will be able to deployment in a fully automated way.

## What is Continuous Deployment?

Continuous deployment (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are
delivered frequently through automated deployments.
CD contrasts with continuous delivery, a similar approach in which software functionalities are also frequently
delivered and deemed to be potentially capable of being deployed but are actually not deployed.
