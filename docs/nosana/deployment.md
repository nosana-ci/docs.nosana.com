# Continuous Deployment <Badge text="alpha" type="error"/>

Nosana's third, and final, product will be the Deployment Suite.
Using this suite, developers will be able to deployment in a fully automated way.

## What is Continuous Deployment?

Continuous deployment (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are 
delivered frequently through automated deployments.
CD contrasts with continuous delivery, a similar approach in which software functionalities are also frequently 
delivered and deemed to be potentially capable of being deployed but are actually not deployed.
