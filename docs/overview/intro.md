::: tip
For every software developer that values transparency and trust.
:::

This is Nosana CI. The only decentralized CI/CD platform, powered by the Solana Network,
and fueled by the <strong>{{ $var.ticker }}</strong> token.

Nosana leverages the Proof-of-History consensus of the Solana Network
to build out decentralized software pipelines. CI by the people, for the people!

::: tip
Run code checks and build container images to earn tokens.
Or simply use other Nosana nodes to run your pipelines on demand!
:::

The platform combines edge-computing and blockchain functionality into a CI/CD marketplace.
The [`NOS`](../tokenomics/metrics) token fuels the system by creating an open
[marketplace](../tokenomics/utility). People and machine can use and
share compute power to execute their software delivery pipelines.

Nosana pipelines, and phases of developement, consist of 3 individual steps.
Which will be developed and released after each other.

- [Nosana Test Suite](../nosana/ci),
   The "Nosana Test Suite" to test assert the codeâ€™s correctness before integration.
- [Nosana Delivery and Deployment Suite](../nosana/cd),
   The "Nosana Release Suite" to build, test and scan your software
- [Nosana DAO](../nosana/dao),
   The "Nosana DAO" helps shape the future of the platform.

All built completely on the Solana Network.

Welcome to Nosana, the platform that consists of everything you need to accelerate your development!
