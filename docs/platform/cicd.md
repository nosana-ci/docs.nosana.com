# ðŸš€ CI/CD

CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the 
lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment. 
Taken together, these connected practices are often referred to as a "CI/CD pipeline" 
and are supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile 
way with either a DevOps or Site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.
