# 👨‍💻 Open Source

Nosana believes in the open source model from its core.
Open source is all around us,
and the most reliable software is open source.

A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, 
with products such as source code, blueprints, 
and documentation freely available to the public. 

The Nosana platform runs CI/CD for open source projects.
In addition, the Nosana platform will be open source itself.
Nosana runs any  CI/CD pipeline openly and transparently.
