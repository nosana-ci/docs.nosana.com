# Token Utility

## Transactions

Nosana CI is an open marketplace for CI/CD.
This means you can earn tokens by sharing your compute resources,
or use your tokens to retrieve compute on demand.

The core token utility is around the exchange between CI/CD artifacts and the `NOS` token.
Once Nosana nodes have run pipeline jobs, the initiator will transfer staked `NOS` tokens
in exchange for these results.

## Staking

### Open source projects

Open source repositories are able to stake `NOS` tokens in Nosana SPL contracts.
This staking will allow them to retrieve compute on demand for their pipelines.

The Nosana platform runs CI/CD for open source projects.
In addition, the Nosana platform will be open source itself.
Nosana runs any  CI/CD pipeline openly and transparently.

::: details Open Source

Open source is all around us,
and the most reliable software is open source.

A main principle of open-source software development is peer production,
with products such as source code, blueprints,
and documentation freely available to the public.

### Nosana Nodes

Nodes in the network are able to stake tokens too to increase their reputation.

## Reputation

Nosana will host Community Nodes to run pipelines. In addition, anybody is able to join 
the network by sharing their compute resources. These can be machines ranging from 
Raspberry Pi's, smartphones, laptops, desktops PCs, as well as full-blown server racks.

Reputation is build based on verified pipelines run by any identity on the network.
Staked tokens can be used to increase reputation so that malicious nodes can be
slashes in case of unwanted behaviour.
