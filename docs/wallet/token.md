# NOS Token

Nosana is powered by the [Solana](https://solana.com/) blockchain. All deployments on Nosana are paid by the [NOS Token](https://nosana.com/token/). **To be explicit; This means you will need to load your wallet with both [NOS](https://nosana.com/token/) and [Sol](https://solana.com/) to pay for the deployments.** SOL is used to pay for the blockchain transactions, and NOS is used to pay for the deployments.

## CLI

When using the [`@nosana/cli`](https://github.com/nosana-ci/nosana-cli) tool, ensure sufficient `NOS/SOL` tokens in your wallet, you will need a minimum of `0.05 SOL`, and a minimum amount of NOS to pay for the Nosana deployment. On the [NVIDIA-3090](https://dashboard.nosana.com/markets/CA5pMpqkYFKtme7K31pNB1s62X2SdhEv1nN9RdxKCpuQ) Market it costs `$0.192/hour`. Make sure you have that amount in NOS for the time that you want to reserve.
